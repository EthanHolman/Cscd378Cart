# Cscd378Cart

This Angular 5 application was for a web development class at Eastern Washington University. I designed this in such a way that it could be added onto more later (it's current state was to satisfy requirements for the class final).

## Live Demo Site

<http://www.ethanholman.com/cscd378/cart>

## Code

* `routed-modules` directory contains the main routed features (like /cart == CartModule)
* `core` directory contains services shared throughout the application
* `shared` directory contains common components that can be reused throughout the application

## Styling

* Application uses sass
* No third party UI libraries are being used

# Building & Running

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
